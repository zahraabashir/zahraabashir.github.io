I graduated with a master's of computer science at the University of Alberta under the supervision of Levi Lelis.
[Levi Lelis](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~santanad/). I'm a machine learning researcher with Ualberta/Amii under Levi's advice doing readearch on neursoymbolic AI.
My primary research interest revolves around answering the question: 'How can we build intelligent systems that learn, reason, and understand the world like humans?' I approach this challenge through the lens of symbolic reasoning and neurosymbolic AI.
