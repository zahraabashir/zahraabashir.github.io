I'm currently a Machine Learning Researcher at UBC affiliated with Vector Institute, working with [Dr. Kelsey Allen](https://k-r-allen.github.io/) @ UBC and [Dr. Tom Silver](https://tomsilver.github.io/) @Princeton Univeristy. Before that, I completed my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Alberta under the supervision of [Dr. Levi Lelis](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~santanad/).
<!-- I'm currently a Research Intern at UBC (University of British Columbia) affiliated with Vector Institute, technically started my PhD research with [Dr. Kelsey Allen](https://k-r-allen.github.io/) @ UBC and [Dr. Tom Silver](https://tomsilver.github.io/) @Princeton Univeristy.

I’m currently working on Programmatic Policies for _Physical Strategy Learning_. Broadly, my research asks: how can we build systems that learn, reason, and understand the world like humans? I explore this through the lens of symbolic reasoning and neurosymbolic AI, using tools from reinforcement learning and imitation learning.
