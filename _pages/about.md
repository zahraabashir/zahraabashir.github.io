I completed a Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Alberta under the supervision of [Levi Lelis](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~santanad/). Currently, I am a Machine Learning researcher at the University of Alberta and Amii, working under Levi's guidance.

My primary research interest revolves around answering the question: "How can we build systems that learn, reason, and understand the world like humans?" I approach this question through the lens of symbolic reasoning and neurosymbolic AI using techniques from reinforcement learning and imitation learning.
